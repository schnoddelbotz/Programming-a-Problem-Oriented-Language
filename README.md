# Programming a Problem-Oriented Language

This is a book [Chuck Moore](https://colorforth.github.io/) wrote about 1970. It describes the software that became Forth.

I tried to read the document online, once, was bored and not so satisfied by the documents' layout that I hacked some perl to produce a PDF from it.

[Charles Havice Moore II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore) wrote Forth, named above, which was used on enterprise grade hardware like from SUN Microsystems. Such machines:

![Sun Microsystems V440 and StorEdge A1000 ? Disk Arrays](IMG_8292.JPG)

![Sun Fire R480 IIRC - maybe wrong](IMG_8293.JPG)

Well. Read more about #OpenBoot #OpenBootProm #PROM #MonitorMode #SUNMicrosystems #SunOS #Solaris on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)).
