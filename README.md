# Programming a Problem-Oriented Language

This is a book [Chuck Moore](https://colorforth.github.io/) wrote about 1970. It describes the software that became Forth.

I tried to read the document online, once, was bored and not so satisfied by the documents' layout that I hacked some perl to produce a PDF from it.

**UPDATE** D'oh - I just figured such PDF existed before, I just did not spot it. You may want to stick with the 
ORIGINAL from the Forth homepage available here: [Original PDF - Programming a Problem-Oriented Language](http://www.forth.org/POL.pdf). I'll still keep this repo online, unless somebody complains... PEACE.

[Charles Havice Moore II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore) wrote Forth, named above, which was used on enterprise grade hardware like from SUN Microsystems. Such machines:

Well. Read more about #OpenBoot #OpenBootProm #PROM #MonitorMode 
#SUNMicrosystems #SunOS #Solaris on 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). 
The biggest SUN was the Sun Enterprise E10K. E10000. AFAIK 
[UBS](https://ubs.com) had one or some to run #Lotus #DOMINO.

The images above have been published here with friendly, self-granted permission
by [BILD](https://bild.de), my employer once. They were taken 2005 in Hamburg.
Today, they'll likely have two or three [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)s
instead, I assume - meaning: Please don't shoot me, but times changed.
This is a historic view into a Server-Raum as we call it half-german.
Just imagine each Powersupply (PSU) had around 800W. And each BOX had two of them,
for redundancy. And if not done wrong, they'd be connected to unrelated powersources.
Ah, maybe that's also why DC works so much better in a PC? Imagine we'd have
to synchronise AC frequency? I am talking rubbish, have no clue.
Was just trying to convince the friendly people at Axel Springer for not shooting me.
PEACE.
